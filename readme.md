## Aim
My intention was to create a static website that is professional, user-friendly that also highlights some of my interests and experience.
4 pages – Intro, About, Work and Interest
Leaving out Contact page as there are links
## Home 
The Home page – very full page background
Initially I had included a slide out menu - this is created in CSS and HTML only activated with via hamburger icon but was replaced with large ‘ghost’ buttons to make it more obvious for the user to navigate.
This page include links to my Linkedin Profile and Github account –fontawesome.io icons were used

## About Me
I tried to make this page different from Intro page in using Bootstrap to add a few more features on this page for UX and east read.
Pics are resized minimal to avoid time loading
Top Nav menu created uses bootstrap and JS, also collapses to Hamburger menu for small width screens.  Menu stays on the top of the screen.
A few more links to my resume for easy navigation while using mobile
Image – on left – text on the right
Text – describing a few things about me

## Work a simple aka resume
Keeping with the format of the About Me page
Highlights of my expertise,  work experience and qualifications
## Interests
A bit more on WHO AM I
##Design
